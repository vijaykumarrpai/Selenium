Testing - Inorder to make sure that the application is working according to customer's requirement, we have to perform testing.

Automation - Performing any task using a tool or machine is automation.

Testing the functionalities of tool is Automation testing.

Advantages of Automation :
1) Saves time.
2) Faster.
3) Less manual effort. 
4) Less human resources.
5) Restless.
6) Multiple tasks.

Disadvantages of Automation :
1) Initial investment is more. - used only when the automation is Long Time Project (LTP).
2) Requires additional skill sets.
3) Constant maintenance.

Selenium - It is a free, open source automation tool which is used to automate web-based applications and it supports 14 programming languages. It supports all browsers and OS.

Advantages of Selenium :
1) To make use of Selenium we don't have to buy any license. It is freely available in following website : https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
2) We can give the source code of Selenium which is available in following website - https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium
3) Using Selenium, we can automate web based application such as Facebook, Gmail, Flipkart etc.
4) Selenium supports for 14 different programming languages.
5) Selenium supports for multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux and Mac.
6) Selenium supports for almost all browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, IE etc

Architecture of Selenium :

Tools for Automation :
jdk(1.8 and above)
Eclipse[Mars, Neon, Oxygen, Photon]
Selenium jar file
Driver executable files
Latest version Browsers[chrome, Firefox]
Application under testing
Search context:
findElement()
findElements()

Webdriver interface:
get()   
getTitle()  
getCurrentUrl() 
getPageSource() 
findElement()   
findElements()
getWindowHandle()
getWindowHandles()
switchTo()
manage()
navigate()
close()
quit()

Takescreenshot:
getScreenShotAs()

javascriptexecutor:
executeScript()
executeAsyncScript()

download all driver files and jar file from the website : https://www.seleniumhq.org/downloads 
extract all driver exe files
in eclipse, create a new java project with name Automation
under the java project, create two folders with the name - drivers and jars 
Store all the extracted driver files under drivers folders
Store selenium jar file in jars folder
Associate the current jar file with current java project

How to associate jar file with current java project : 
Expand jars folder
Right click, open jar file
Go to build path
Click on add to build path

Before performing action on any elements, we have to perform following steps : 
Inspect the element
Identify/locate the element
Find the element
Perform the action

Inspect the element :
In Order to inspect the element, right click on the element
Click on inspect element option which will return the source code of the element

Note : For security purpose, in some of the applications right click option will be disabled. In such cases to inspect the element : 
Press F12
Click on inspect element icon
Click on the element present on the web page

Locators : 
1)  Locators are the static methods which are used to identify the elements which are present on the web page.
2) All these locators are present in a class called By which is a abstract class
3) There are 8 types of Locators. All the locators takes the argument of type String
4) The different types of locators are : 
id(str)
name(str)
className(str)
tagName(str)
linkText(str)
partialLinkText(str)
css Selector(str)
xPath(str)

Note: Out of all the locators id, name, className are available as attributes of an element.

To handle the single element, we use find element method.
In find element method, if the specified locator is not matching with any elements, it will throw no such element exception.

In find element method, if the specified locator is matching with multiple element then it returns address of first matching element.

If the specified element is a link then we can identify that element by using the locator link text
If the link is partially dynamic then we can identify that element by using partial link text
